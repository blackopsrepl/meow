# MEOW
### Mystical Efficiency, Organized Whiskers!
## Overview
MEOW, the Cheshire AI plugin, dances in delight to support our neurodiverse friends by turning their whimsical thoughts and scattered ideas into purrfectly organized lists and tasks.

## Project Goals
Oh, the wonders we aim to weave with MEOW (-> it comes from a grander, secret “second brain” tapestry!):
- Spark and nurture collaboration to untangle neurodiversity, especially those pesky executive function knots.
- Showcase the magic of neurosymbolic AI in solving such conundrums.
- So enchanting... even the most ordinary folk might find it irresistible.
- Aid the free-software realm in releasing these wonders first.

## Features
- Task Decomposer (like a cat with a yarn ball)
- Subtask Estimator (locating catnip and predicting the number of naps needed)
- Task Outline Composer (sketching out the cat’s path)
- Task Timetable Composer (organizing the cat’s day)

### Upcoming
- Custom alerting system (meows when meh)
- Multimodal input (Oh, the possibilities!)
- Timetable & Calendar constraint solver (even a cat needs structure :roll:)
- Signal bot support
